// Part 2: Multi-Dimensional Arrays and Tuples - Student Grades
// Challenge:
// You are tasked with creating a student grading system. Implement functions and logic to
// manage student grades effectively.
// 1. Define a TypeScript type alias named Student to represent a student with the
// following properties:
// â€¢ name (string): The name of the student.
// â€¢ grades (number[ ]): An array of grades for different subjects.
